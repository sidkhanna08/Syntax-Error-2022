# Block Ballot
We often hear various concerns regarding the credibility of an election result or how inaccessible are those voting rights to some sections of society. Team Reality Warpers has tried solving these problems by using block chain to record votes and hence try and make the voting system more transparent, decentralized, enhance its credibility and even increase its reach.

# Blockchain Voting
In elections we usually have a central authority that records, counts and checks all votes with block chain, the process is decentralized and thus every device could hold the full voting records. The data is encrypted to protect the identity of individual voters. Illegitimate votes cannot be added, and historical record cannot be changed as everyone holds a copy and can check that all votes comply with rules and are counted properly.
Block chain could help voters engage more deeply and make decision-making more fluid.
People could even vote more regularly and even we could provide them with option to update their vote if they change their mind. We could declare automatic results once the voting is done. Block chain voting could increase voter turnout by appealing more to young people and allowing citizen to vote on their own devices, whenever they want.

# Project Operation
In this project we have tried implementing the above said block chain system as a simple app. In the app you can perform the following operations:

•	Create polls: Using the app you can create customized polls for people to vote upon

•	Vote: You can vote on different polls created by people 

•	Login: To vote in polls you have to login in using a unique id, to ensure every person only votes once

•	View Result: Once the voting is done, we can view poll results using   result button in polling tab
